# CS 271 Computer Architecture - ARM Labs

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/JaydJohns/CS-Architecture-ARM-Labs)

## Overview

This repository contains the lab assignments for **CS 271 Computer Architecture** at Purdue University Fort Wayne. Students will learn ARM64 assembly programming using the **Arm Education Core (Educore)** processor, simulated in Icarus Verilog.

## Getting Started

### 1. Open in Codespaces

Click the button above or go to **Code → Codespaces → Create codespace on main**.

The environment will automatically install:
- ARM64 cross-compiler (`gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu`)
- Icarus Verilog simulator (`iverilog`)
- Surfer waveform viewer extension

### 2. Verify Your Setup

After the Codespace finishes building (~2 minutes), run:

```bash
make sim_lab00
```

You should see:
```
[EDUCORE LOG]: Test case: Lab00/hello_arm.mem
[EDUCORE LOG]: Apollo has landed
```

## Lab Assignments

| Lab | Topic | File to Edit |
|-----|-------|--------------|
| Lab 00 | Getting Started | `Lab00/hello_arm.s` |
| Lab 01 | String Copy (STRCPY) | `Lab01/test_STRCPY.s` |

## Quick Reference

### Common Commands

```bash
# Build and simulate Lab 00
make sim_lab00

# Build and simulate Lab 01
make sim_lab01

# Clean all build artifacts
make clean

# Show all available commands
make help
```

### Viewing Waveforms

After running a simulation, a `.vcd` file is generated. To view:

1. Click on the `.vcd` file in the Explorer
2. It will open in the Surfer waveform viewer
3. Add signals to trace (e.g., registers, memory)
